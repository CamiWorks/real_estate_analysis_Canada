# Real Estate Analysis *Canda Only*

This project focuses on the real estate analysis on the Canadian territory.

# How to set before using it.

This project involves utilizing a Real Estate API (https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/realty-in-ca1/). You are required to set up your own key for the program to function. To do this, open 'real_estate.py,' locate line 7, add your personal key from the API, save the file, and then close it.

After completing the setup, execute the command 'python data_processing.py', in your terminal. Subsequently, the program will prompt you to input an address. 

Ensure that the address is formatted correctly, such as:

ADDRESS OR LOCALITY, CITY, PROVINCE, COUNTRY.

Once you input the address, press Enter, and that's it. You will receive a success message indicating that everything went smoothly. If not, try again and verify your input.

Afterward, you'll notice that within the folder containing the app, a new folder labeled 'REPORT_XXXXXXX' has been created. This folder contains the report you just generated about the inputted location. Open it and click on the index file with extension ".html".

Inside, you'll find a comprehensive web report that you can easily share or print if needed by pressing 'Ctrl + P' or 'Cmd + P' on macOS.

I hope this proves helpful for future implementations.

Cheers!
