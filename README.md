# real_estate_analysis_Canada

This project focuses on the real estate analysis on the Canadian territory.

# How to set before using it.

This project called a Real_Estate API (https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/realty-in-ca1/) you will be required to set your own key, so the program will work. 

To do that go and open 'real_estate.py' on line 7 add your own key from the API save the file an close it.

after that you can just execute on yout terminal with the command 'python data_processing.py' (python3), after, the program will prompt you to input an address, you can go ahead and input the address make sure is in the right formating such as;

ADDRESS OR LOCALITY, CITY, PROVINCE, COUNTRY.

Once you input the address hit enter and that is all, you after will have a success message telling you everything went fine, if not try again and verify your input. 

after you will realize within the folder where the app is being contained a new folder has been created heading 'REPORT_XXXXXXX' that is your report you just created about the place you input. go ahead open it and click on the index of the file. 

after you will see a full web report that you can share or even print if required pressing crl + f or cmd + f on maOS.

Hope this might be some help for you. In some way or to do some homework

Cheers!!!
